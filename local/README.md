# Local deployment

## Prerequisites

This deployment uses `docker compose` for you to develop, run and test the application locally. Also, `make` is used to simplify the process of building, running and testing the application.

You need to have both services installed on your machine:

- [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## How to use

Just run the following command to list the available recipes:

```bash
make
```
